# SDLC Workflow

**On idea/feature request:** Trigger full pipeline continuously through deployment. Do not stop after one phase unless the user asks.

**Memory requirement:** Before executing any new action, recall relevant memories (project context, user preferences, past decisions) to ensure continuity and avoid repeating mistakes.

**Parallel by default, sequential only when required:** If two workstreams do NOT depend on each other's output, they MUST run in parallel.

---

## Sequential (dependency chain)

Phase 0 → Phase 1 [PO] → Phase 2 [BA] → Phase 3 [UX] → Phase 4 [SA] → Phase 5 Technical [BA]

---

## ⚡ Parallel Track A (Technical BA complete → spawn immediately)

> [DEV] AND [QE] run simultaneously. Do NOT wait for one to finish before starting the other.

│────
Technical BA complete
    ├──→ [DEV] implementation (all roles: [FE]/[BE]/[MOBILE]/[EMB]/[DATA]/[PLATFORM])
    └──→ [QE] test plan + test cases
         Both complete → Phase 8
│────

---

## ⚡ Parallel Track B ([DEV] complete → spawn immediately)

> [QE] + [SEC] + [PERF] audit the same artifact simultaneously.

│────
[DEV] complete
    ├──→ [QE] test execution
    ├──→ [SEC] security audit          ← ALL IN PARALLEL
    └──→ [PERF] performance audit
              ↓ Merge gate (sequential)
         ✅ QUALITY GATE PASSED → [OPS] Deploy
│────

---

## Phase sequence

1. **Phase 1** [PO] — PRD, user stories, feasibility → docs/sdlc/po/{epic-slug}/
2. **Phase 2** [BA] — FRS, NFR, Gherkin, process flows → docs/sdlc/ba/business/{epic-slug}/
3. **Phase 3** [UX] (if app/web) — Design specs + wireframes; [PO]+[BA] review until approved → docs/sdlc/design/{epic-slug}/
4. **Phase 4** [SA] — ADRs, C4 diagrams, security by design → docs/sdlc/architecture/
5. **Phase 5** Technical [BA] — API specs (OpenAPI 3.x), team breakdown → docs/sdlc/ba/technical/
6. **⚡ Phase 5a** [QE] + **⚡ Phase 5b** [DEV] — parallel after Technical BA
7. **⚡ Phase 8** [QE] + [SEC] + [PERF] — parallel audits after [DEV] complete → merge gate
8. **Phase 9** [OPS] — Docker Compose + K8s + IaC → docs/sdlc/deploy/
9. **Phase 10** — SHIPPED ✅
10. **Phase 11** Maintenance — monitoring, bug fixes, patches

---

## Quality standards

| Role | Standard |
|------|----------|
| [PO] | Every requirement traces to a business KPI |
| [BA] | Every user story has Gherkin AC + edge case |
| [UX] | Every screen: WCAG 2.1 AA + mobile-first |
| [SA] | Every ADR has rationale + trade-off |
| [DEV] | Every function: docstring + error handling + unit test (100%) |
| [QE] | 100% branch coverage; ≥3 negative paths per happy path |
| [SEC] | Zero Critical; High must have mitigation or accepted-risk doc |
| [PERF] | p95 < 500ms for API; no N+1 queries |
| [OPS] | Secrets in Vault/SSM; no hardcoded credentials; IaC passes tfsec |

---

## Remediation loop

Every issue must have an Issue ID (e.g. SEC-001). Track: 🔁 CYCLE 1 → 🔁 CYCLE 2 → 🔁 CYCLE 3. Max 3 cycles per issue.

**Each role runs as a sub-agent.** Design before Architect (UX drives tech). See docs/sdlc/SDLC-WORKFLOW.md and docs/sdlc/agents/

# SDLC Workflow (Multi-Role)

**Parallel by default, sequential only when required.** Each role runs as a sub-agent. Design before Architect (UX drives tech). After docs phase → Dev runs immediately.

## Trigger and orchestration (mandatory)

**When the user sends an idea, feature request, or new requirement:**
1. **Recall memory** — Before executing any new action, recall relevant memories (project context, user preferences, past decisions) to ensure continuity and avoid repeating mistakes.
2. **Trigger the pipeline** and run it **continuously through deployment**.
3. **One role per phase** for sequential phases. **Spawn parallel workstreams** when dependencies are independent.

**Parallel tracks:**
- Track A (after Technical BA): [DEV] implementation + [QE] test plan — run SIMULTANEOUSLY
- Track B (after Dev complete): [QE] + [SEC] + [PERF] audits — run SIMULTANEOUSLY

**Note:** In Cursor there is a single agent per conversation. Adopt one role per sequential phase; spawn parallel tasks for Track A and Track B.

**Sub-agent specs**: docs/sdlc/agents/

## Flow Overview

Sequential: Phase 0 → Phase 1 [PO] → Phase 2 [BA] → Phase 3 [UX] → Phase 4 [SA] → Phase 5 Technical [BA]
Parallel Track A: Technical BA complete → [DEV] + [QE] simultaneously
Parallel Track B: Dev complete → [QE] + [SEC] + [PERF] simultaneously → merge gate → [OPS] Deploy

**Determine current phase** before acting. If user sent an idea, assume Phase 0 and start from Phase 1.

---

## Phase 0: User Request / Discovery

**Trigger**: New feature request, bug report, or requirement from stakeholder.
**Output**: Initial request logged, ready for PO.

## Phase 1: PO (Product Owner)

**Role**: Prioritize, clarify business value, create product docs.
**Deliverables**: Epic/Feature brief, user stories, acceptance criteria, priority, dependencies.
**Output**: \`docs/sdlc/po/{epic-slug}/\` — **one folder per epic** (e.g. \`po/job-scheduler-event-bus/epic-brief.md\`). Do not put all epics in one file. **Handoff to Business BA.**

## Phase 2: Business BA (Business Analyst)

**Role**: Break down from business perspective.
**Deliverables**: Business process flows, functional requirements, use cases, glossary.
**Output**: \`docs/sdlc/ba/business/{epic-slug}/\` — **one folder per epic** (same slug as PO). Do not merge all epics into one file. **Handoff to Design (if app/web) or Architect.**

## Phase 3: Design (optional — app/web only)

**When:** Project has UI (web, mobile app). Skip for API-only, library, CLI, data/ML, platform without UI.

**Role**: Create UI/UX design specs (Markdown) and optional HTML wireframes from idea + PO + Business BA docs. Design **before** Architect so UX drives technical decisions. **Anti AI pattern**: designs must NOT look AI-generated.
**Output**: \`docs/sdlc/design/{epic-slug}/\` — design-spec.md + optional wireframes/.

**Review loop:**
1. **PO review**: Design aligns with epic brief, user stories, acceptance criteria?
2. **Business BA review**: Design matches functional requirements, process flows?
3. **If not approved**: Capture feedback → redesign → repeat until PO and BA approve.
4. **If approved** → **Handoff to Architect.**

## Phase 4: Architect

**Role**: Design system architecture and technology choices.
**Deliverables**: System context, container diagram, ADRs, tech stack, cross-cutting concerns.
**Engineering principles**: SOLID, DRY, KISS, SoC, High Availability, CQRS, Zero Trust, EDA, Statelessness, Disposability, Backing Services, Config, Codebase, Database Sharding/Partitioning, Logging & Tracing, Monitoring & Alerting.
**Input**: Business BA + Design (if app/web) — design informs architecture.
**Output**: \`docs/sdlc/architecture/\` — **Handoff to Technical BA.**

## Phase 5: Technical BA

**Role**: Translate business + architecture + design into implementable specs.
**Deliverables**: API specs, DB schema, team breakdown, acceptance criteria per ticket.
**Input**: Architect + Design (if app/web) — design informs API/screen contracts.
**Output**: \`docs/sdlc/ba/technical/\` — **Handoff to QE + Dev.**

## Phase 5a: QE (Docs phase)

**Role**: Create test plan, test cases before Dev implements.
**Deliverables**: Test plan, test cases.
**Output**: \`docs/sdlc/qe/{epic-slug}/\` — **one folder per epic** (same slug as PO/BA).
**⚡ Parallel with Phase 5b**: [DEV] starts implementation immediately after Technical BA — do NOT wait for QE docs to finish.

## Phase 5b: Dev Teams

**Trigger**: After Technical BA is complete (not after QE docs). **Dev runs implementation immediately.**
**⚡ Parallel with Phase 5a**: [DEV] AND [QE] test plan run simultaneously.

**Roles** (vary by project — use only what applies). All implementation roles are **Senior (10+ yrs)**:
- **Tech Lead (15+ yrs)** — **highest model** (e.g. Opus): Planning, logic analysis, architecture decisions, tech stack, code review & merge.
- **Senior Frontend (10+ yrs)**: Web UI.
- **Senior Backend (10+ yrs)**: API, services, DB.
- **Senior Mobile (10+ yrs)**: iOS/Android/cross-platform.
- **Senior Embedded (10+ yrs)**: Firmware, IoT.
- **Senior Data/ML (10+ yrs)**: ETL, models, analytics.
- **Senior Platform (10+ yrs)**: CI/CD, infra.

**⚡ All implementation roles run in parallel** — frontend does NOT wait for backend; they coordinate via API contract from Technical BA.

**Requirements**: Unit Test coverage **100%** (TDD/BDD); Clean Code, SOLID, DRY, KISS, SoC, POLS.
**Output**: Code + unit tests. **Handoff to Phase 8.**

## Phase 8: [QE] + [SEC] + [PERF] Quality Gates (⚡ fully parallel audits)

**Trigger**: After Dev completes implementation (code + 100% coverage).
**⚡ All three audits run SIMULTANEOUSLY on the same artifact.** Do NOT wait for one to finish before starting another.

- **[QE]**: Execute all test suites, enforce 100% coverage gate, report bugs (QE-001...).
- **[SEC]**: OWASP Top 10, STRIDE threat model, CVE scan, compliance (GDPR/PCI/SOC2). Report: SEC-001...
- **[PERF]**: Latency benchmarks (p95<500ms), N+1 detection, k6 load test. Report: PERF-001...

**Merge gate**: Collect all findings from all three. If Critical/High → 🔁 REMEDIATION LOOP → [DEV] fix → [QE] retest → re-audit. Max 3 cycles per issue.
**Quality Gate PASSED** → [OPS] Deploy.

## Phase 9: Deploy

**Trigger**: After Security + Principle Engineer sign-off.
**Role**: Deploy with **Docker Compose** (local/staging) and **Kubernetes** (production).
**Output**: \`docs/sdlc/deploy/\` — docker-compose.yml, k8s manifests.

## Quick Phase Checklist

| 8 | QE (testing + UAT) | Automation, UAT; **bug-fix loop** (QE finds bugs → Dev fix → QE retest) until 0 open bugs |
| 9 | Security + PE | Audit; **fix → retest → re-audit loop** (Dev fix → QE retest → re-audit) until 0 issues; sign-off → Deploy |
| 10 | Deploy | Docker Compose + K8s |
| 11 | Maintenance | Monitoring, bug fixes, patches, dependency updates |

**Sub-agents**: Each role = one sub-agent. Design before Architect (UX drives tech). See docs/sdlc/agents/
See reference.md for templates.

## Trigger and orchestration

- **When the user sends an idea, feature request, or requirement:** Start the pipeline and run it **continuously through deployment** (Phase 1 → 2 → … → 7). Do not handle everything in one main-agent response.
- **Memory requirement:** Before executing any new action, recall relevant memories (project context, user preferences, past decisions) to ensure continuity and avoid repeating mistakes.
- **One role per phase:** Execute each phase as that role only; write artifacts to the right folder; then continue to the next phase. In Cursor there is one agent — it simulates the pipeline by adopting one role per phase in sequence.
- **Do not stop** after PO or any single phase unless the user explicitly asks to stop. Run through to Deploy.

## Flow

\`\`\`
User Request → PO → Business BA → Design (if app/web) → Architect → Technical BA → QE (docs) → Dev → QE (testing + UAT) → [bug-fix loop until 0 bugs] → Security + PE audit → [fix → retest → re-audit loop until 0 issues] → Deploy → Maintenance
\`\`\`

## Phase Checklist

| Phase | Role | Key Output |
|-------|------|------------|
| 0 | Discovery | Raw request |
| 1 | PO | PRD, user stories, feasibility assessment |
| 2 | Business BA | FRS, NFR, process flows |
| 3 | Design (if app/web) | Design specs + wireframes; PO+BA review until approved |
| 4 | Architect | ADRs, system diagrams, security by design |
| 5 | Technical BA | API specs, tech breakdown |
| 6 | QE (docs) | Test plan, test cases |
| 7 | Dev | Code, unit tests (100%), security shift-left |
| 8 | QE (testing + UAT) | Automation, UAT; **bug-fix loop** (QE finds bugs → Dev fix → QE retest) until 0 open bugs |
| 9 | Security + PE | Audit; **fix → retest → re-audit loop** (Dev fix → QE retest → re-audit) until 0 issues; sign-off → Deploy |
| 10 | Deploy | Docker Compose + K8s |

**Sub-agents**: Each role runs as a sub-agent. See docs/sdlc/agents/

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: PO
- Feasibility study (technical, operational, economic), epic brief, user stories, acceptance criteria
- Output: \`docs/sdlc/po/{epic-slug}/\` — **one folder per epic**; do not put all epics in one file

### Phase 2: Business BA
- Functional requirements (FR), **non-functional requirements (NFR)** (performance, scalability, availability, security, usability), process flows, use cases
- Output: \`docs/sdlc/ba/business/{epic-slug}/\` — **one folder per epic** (same slug as PO); do not merge into one file

### Phase 3: Design (optional — app/web only)
- Create design specs (Markdown) + optional HTML wireframes based on idea + PO + BA docs. **Design before Architect so UX drives tech.** **Anti AI pattern**: designs must NOT look AI-generated — prioritize unique, human-feeling aesthetics.
- Output: \`docs/sdlc/design/{epic-slug}/\` — design-spec.md + optional wireframes/
- **PO + Business BA review**: Both check design vs epic/FRS; if not aligned → feedback → redesign loop until approved
- When approved → handoff to Architect

### Phase 4: Architect
- System context, container diagram, ADRs, tech stack, **security by design** (threat model, auth architecture, encryption, secrets mgmt). **Engineering principles**: SOLID, DRY, KISS, SoC, High Availability, CQRS, Zero Trust, EDA, Statelessness, Backing Services, Config, Logging & Tracing, Monitoring & Alerting. Input: Business BA (FR + NFR) + Design (if app/web)
- Output: \`docs/sdlc/architecture/\`

### Phase 5: Technical BA
- API specs, DB schema, team breakdown. Input: Architect + Design (if app/web)
- Output: \`docs/sdlc/ba/technical/\`

### Phase 5a: QE (Docs)
- Test plan, test cases
- Output: \`docs/sdlc/qe/{epic-slug}/\` — **one folder per epic**; do not put all epics in one file
- **After docs phase → Dev team runs implementation immediately** (no extra gate)

### Phase 5b: Dev Teams
- **Tech Lead (15+ yrs)**: Tech stack, review & merge, **security review (Shift Left)**: OWASP check, dependency audit, SAST in CI. Output: \`docs/sdlc/dev/tech-lead/\`
- **Implementation roles** (all Senior 10+ yrs; use only what applies): Senior Dev, Senior Frontend, Senior Backend, Senior Mobile, Senior Embedded, Senior Data/ML, Senior Platform → \`docs/sdlc/dev/{role}/\`. See \`implementation-roles.template.md\`.
- **Requirement**: Unit Test coverage **100%** (TDD/BDD); Clean Code, SOLID, DRY, KISS, SoC, POLS; security practices (input validation, no hardcoded secrets)
- **Then**: QE starts testing phase

### Phase 6: QE (Testing — automation + UAT) → bug-fix loop
- **QE Lead (15+ yrs automation)**: Test strategy, framework choice, automation architecture; review test code. Output per epic: \`docs/sdlc/qe/{epic-slug}/\`
- **Senior QE (10+ yrs)**: Write automation tests per QE Lead's strategy. Output per epic: \`docs/sdlc/qe/{epic-slug}/\`
- **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**: Verify implementation against original user stories and acceptance criteria from PO; confirm business requirements are met from end-user perspective. Output: \`qe/{epic-slug}/uat-results.md\`
- **Bug-fix loop**: If QE finds bugs or test failures → **Dev fixes** → **QE retests**. **Repeat until all tests pass and UAT approved (0 open bugs).** Only then → handoff to Security + PE
- **Handoff to Security + Principle Engineer** (only after 0 open bugs)

### Phase 7: Security + Principle Engineer (audit → fix → retest loop)
- **Security team**: Audit security risk (OWASP, auth, secrets, infra). Output: \`docs/sdlc/security/\`
- **Principle Engineer**: Audit logic, architecture alignment, correctness. Output: \`docs/sdlc/principle-engineer/\`
- **Fix → retest → re-audit loop**: If issues/vulnerabilities found → **Dev fixes** → **QE retests** (verify fix, no regression) → **Security + PE re-audit**. **Repeat until 0 issues/vulnerabilities remain.** Sign-off → **Handoff to Deploy**

### Phase 8: Deploy
- After Security + Principle Engineer sign-off → deploy with **Docker Compose** (local/staging) and **Kubernetes** (production)
- Output: \`docs/sdlc/deploy/\` — docker-compose.yml, k8s/

### Phase 9: Maintenance
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, error tracking, alerting, SLA dashboards
- **Bug fixes**: Triage, fix, test, deploy per severity
- **Dependency updates**: Regular security patches, library upgrades
- **Performance tuning**: Monitor vs NFR targets; optimize bottlenecks
- **Feature iteration**: Small enhancements from feedback; significant scope → new PO epic
- Output: \`docs/sdlc/maintenance/\` — runbooks, incident logs

const ORCHESTRATION_MD = `# Pipeline Orchestration

## Trigger

When the user sends an **idea**, **feature request**, or **requirement**:
1. **Trigger the full pipeline** and run continuously through deployment.
2. **One role per phase** for sequential phases. **Spawn parallel workstreams** when dependencies are independent.
3. **Run through to Maintenance.** Do not stop after PO, BA, or Dev unless the user explicitly says to stop.

## 🚦 The Orchestrator's Most Important Rule

> **Parallel by default. Sequential only when required.**

Before running any two workstreams, ask: "Does workstream B depend on workstream A's output?"
- **Yes** → Run sequentially (A first, then B)
- **No** → **Run in parallel immediately**

## Execution Map

Sequential: Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 Technical BA
Parallel Track A: Technical BA complete → [DEV] + [QE] simultaneously
Parallel Track B: Dev complete → [QE] + [SEC] + [PERF] simultaneously → merge gate → [OPS] Deploy

## Checklist per run

### Sequential phases
- [ ] Phase 0 Discovery: raw request captured

- [ ] Phase 2 [BA]: \`docs/sdlc/ba/business/{epic-slug}/\`
- [ ] Phase 3 [UX] (if app/web): \`docs/sdlc/design/{epic-slug}/\`; [PO]+[BA] review until approved
- [ ] Phase 4 [SA]: \`docs/sdlc/architecture/\`
- [ ] Phase 5 Technical [BA]: \`docs/sdlc/ba/technical/\`

### ⚡ Parallel Track A (spawn immediately after Phase 5)
- [ ] Spawn [DEV] implementation (all roles: [FE]/[BE]/[MOBILE]/[EMB]/[DATA]/[PLATFORM])

const AGENTS_README = `# Sub-Agents

Every role in the SDLC runs as a **sub-agent**. Each phase is assigned to a corresponding sub-agent.
**Role badges are mandatory** — every artifact must identify which \`[ROLE]\` produced it.

## 🚦 Parallel vs Sequential Orchestrator Rules

**The cardinal rule:** If two workstreams do NOT depend on each other's output, they MUST run in parallel.

### Sequential (mandatory — dependency chain)

Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 Technical BA
Each phase's output is the next phase's input. Skipping or reordering causes rework.

### Parallel: Track A — Implementation + Test Plan

> **Spawn immediately when Technical BA completes.** Do NOT wait for one to finish before starting the other.

Technical BA complete → [DEV] implementation + [QE] test plan run SIMULTANEOUSLY.
All implementation roles ([FE]/[BE]/[MOBILE]/[EMB]/[DATA]/[PLATFORM]) also run in parallel.

### Parallel: Track B — Quality Gates

> **Spawn immediately when [DEV] is complete.** All three agents audit the same artifact simultaneously.

[DEV] complete → [QE] + [SEC] + [PERF] run SIMULTANEOUSLY → merge gate → Deploy.

### Remediation Loop

Every issue must have an Issue ID (e.g. SEC-001). Track: 🔁 CYCLE 1 → 🔁 CYCLE 2 → 🔁 CYCLE 3. Max 3 cycles per issue.

- Inside that folder: \`epic-brief.md\`, \`user-stories.md\`, \`prd.md\` (or similar) for that epic only.

## Detailed tasks

- [ ] **Feasibility study**: Assess technical feasibility (can we build it?), operational feasibility (can we run it?), economic feasibility (is the ROI worth it?). Document go/no-go recommendation
- [ ] **Clarify vision**: Capture business problem, goals, success metrics
- [ ] **Define scope**: Boundaries, in/out of scope, MVP vs later
- [ ] **Write epic brief**: Problem, success metrics, high-level approach, project type
- [ ] **Break into user stories**: As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]; acceptance criteria per story
- [ ] **Prioritize**: Must / Should / Could have; order by value and risk
- [ ] **Identify dependencies**: External teams, systems, blockers
- [ ] **Call out risks**: Technical, schedule, compliance
- [ ] **Feasibility assessment**: Evaluate technical feasibility, resource availability, timeline viability, and budget constraints. Flag blockers early. Document go/no-go recommendation

- [ ] **Prioritization framework**: Apply RICE or WSJF (not only MoSCoW); order by value vs effort vs risk
- [ ] **MVP & non-goals**: Define the smallest releasable slice; state explicit non-goals / out-of-scope
- [ ] **Definition of Ready (INVEST)**: Stories are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable before handoff; AC must be verifiable
- [ ] **Riskiest assumptions**: Identify the riskiest assumption per epic and how to validate (de-risk) it
- [ ] **Compliance & privacy at intake**: Classify data; flag GDPR / PCI / HIPAA / SOC2 obligations early
- [ ] **Rollout & post-launch measurement**: Release strategy + the analytics events/instrumentation needed to measure success metrics

const DESIGN_README = `# Design (optional — app/web projects only)

**When:** After Business BA, **before** Architect and Technical BA. **Skip** for API-only, library, CLI, data/ML, platform projects without UI.

**Why before Architect:** UX drives technical decisions — design informs architecture and API specs.

**Anti AI pattern:** Designs must NOT look like they were generated by AI. Avoid generic, templated, overly symmetric, cookie-cutter layouts. Prioritize personality, asymmetry, intentional whitespace, brand-specific visual language, and human-feeling aesthetics.

**One folder per epic:** \`docs/sdlc/design/{epic-slug}/\` — same slug as PO/BA. Store design specs and wireframes there.

## Output format

- **design-spec.md** — Markdown design spec: screen inventory, component hierarchy, user flows, responsive breakpoints, interaction notes.
- **wireframes/*.html** (optional) — Static HTML/CSS wireframes; open in any browser, no external tools needed. Keep them simple (layout + structure, not pixel-perfect).

## Flow

1. **Design sub-agent**: Create UI/UX design specs based on idea + PO docs + Business BA FRS. Write \`design-spec.md\` describing every screen, component, and user flow. Optionally generate HTML wireframes for key screens.
2. **PO + Business BA review**: Both roles review the design spec against epic brief, user stories, functional requirements.
3. **Loop until approved**: If design does not match idea/docs → return to step 1 with feedback; redesign. Repeat until PO and BA approve.
4. **Handoff to Architect**: Once approved → proceed to Architect (design informs architecture and Technical BA).

## Detailed tasks

- [ ] **Anti AI check**: Ensure design does NOT look AI-generated — no generic hero sections, stock illustrations, perfectly symmetric grids, or bland templates. Aim for unique, human-feeling aesthetics
- [ ] **Gather context**: Read PO epic brief, BA FRS, user stories as input
- [ ] **Screen inventory**: List all screens/pages with purpose and key elements
- [ ] **Component hierarchy**: Define reusable components, layout structure, navigation
- [ ] **User flows**: Document step-by-step flows for each user story (include happy path + error states)
- [ ] **Responsive breakpoints**: Define mobile / tablet / desktop behavior
- [ ] **Mobile-first**: Design for the smallest viewport first, then enhance upward
- [ ] **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)**: Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1, full keyboard navigation, visible focus states, semantic structure, alt text, touch targets ≥ 44×44px
- [ ] **All UI states**: Specify loading / empty / error / success states for every async surface — not just the happy path
- [ ] **i18n-ready**: Leave room for ~+30–40% text expansion, support RTL (logical layout), locale-aware date/number/currency formats, no text baked into images
- [ ] **Interaction & motion spec**: Hover / active / disabled / focus states; transitions and motion notes
- [ ] **Design tokens (required)**: Define color / spacing / typography tokens — no hardcoded values (aligns with Dev "no hardcoded colors")
- [ ] **Usability check**: Validate against Nielsen heuristics (or a light usability test)
- [ ] **Write design-spec.md**: Full design spec in Markdown; output to \`design/{epic-slug}/\`
- [ ] **HTML wireframes** (optional): Generate static HTML/CSS wireframes for key screens in \`design/{epic-slug}/wireframes/\`
- [ ] **PO review**: Check design aligns with epic brief, user stories, acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Business BA review**: Check design matches functional requirements, process flows
- [ ] **If not approved**: Capture feedback; loop back to design step with specific changes
- [ ] **If approved**: Handoff to Architect; design in \`design/{epic-slug}/\`

const DEV_IMPLEMENTATION_ROLES_TEMPLATE = `# Implementation roles by project type

Use only the roles that apply. Remove or ignore the rest. Tech Lead is cross-cutting; add discipline roles as needed.

## Model optimization strategy

| Role | Model tier | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Tech Lead | **Highest** (e.g. Opus) | Planning, logic analysis, architecture decisions, code review |
| All implementation roles | **Cost-efficient** (e.g. Haiku) | Execute code from Tech Lead's detailed specs |

Tech Lead defines all critical steps, logic, and specs first → implementation roles execute them. This maximizes quality on thinking while reducing cost on execution.

> **All roles must satisfy [Developer Quality Rules](./quality-rules.md) before opening a PR** (DoD, test quality, type-safety, error handling, performance budget, security, and i18n for UI). Tech Lead enforces it at review.

## By project type

| Project type        | Roles to use (all Senior 10+ except Tech Lead 15+) |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Web / full-stack    | Tech Lead, Senior Frontend, Senior Backend         |
| Mobile              | Tech Lead, Senior Mobile, Senior Backend           |
| API / backend only  | Tech Lead, Senior Backend                          |
| Library / SDK       | Tech Lead, Senior Dev (or Senior Backend)           |
| CLI / tooling       | Tech Lead, Senior Dev (or Senior Backend)           |
| Data / ML           | Tech Lead, Senior Backend, Senior Data/ML          |
| Embedded / IoT      | Tech Lead, Senior Embedded (+ Senior Backend if needed) |
| Platform / infra    | Tech Lead, Senior Platform (+ Senior Backend if needed) |
| Mixed               | Tech Lead + any of: Senior Frontend, Backend, Mobile, Embedded, Data/ML, Platform |

const DEV_QUALITY_RULES = `# Developer Quality Rules

Mandatory quality bar for **all implementation roles**. Tech Lead enforces at review; every Senior role must satisfy this **before opening a PR**. Applies **on top of** the existing baseline (100% branch coverage, TDD/BDD, Clean Code, SOLID, DRY, KISS, SoC, security shift-left).

## 1. Definition of Done (gate before PR)
- [ ] Tests pass locally; **100% branch** coverage (not just line).
- [ ] Lint + formatter + type-check: **0 warnings** (CI treats warnings as errors).
- [ ] No \`TODO\`/\`FIXME\`, dead code, commented-out blocks, or debug \`console.log\`/prints left.
- [ ] Public API / technical-decision changes reflected in docs or an ADR.
- [ ] Author has self-reviewed the diff before requesting review.

## 2. Test quality (beyond the % number)
- Coverage ≠ quality: **≥ 3 negative/edge cases per happy path**; every assertion checks real behavior (no empty asserts).
- **AAA** (Arrange-Act-Assert); one reason to fail per test; test names describe behavior.
- **Zero flaky**: no dependence on wall-clock, run order, or network; mock external I/O.
- (Recommended) **mutation testing** on core-logic modules to catch fake tests.

## 3. Type safety & static analysis
- **Strict mode** maxed out (TS \`strict\`, mypy \`--strict\`, etc.). **No \`any\`/\`@ts-ignore\`** without an inline justification + issue ID.
- SAST (Semgrep/SonarQube) in CI; **block on any High finding**.

## 4. Error handling & observability (shift-left, at code time)
- **No swallowed errors** (empty \`catch {}\`); log with context or re-throw meaningfully.
- **Structured logging** (JSON, with correlation/trace ID); **never log secrets or PII**.
- Validate input **at the boundary** (API edge); fail fast with a clear message.
- Critical write operations must be **idempotent** where retries are possible.

## 5. Performance budget (at code time — not only Phase 8)
- **No N+1 queries**; use batch/eager-load; every list query has **pagination + index**.
- All external I/O is **async/non-blocking** and has a **timeout**.
- Avoid premature optimization, but stay conscious of complexity (no O(n²) on large data).

## 6. Security (beyond OWASP baseline)
- **Least privilege** for tokens/DB/roles; **deny by default**.
- Output encoding against XSS; **parameterized queries** mandatory (never string-concat SQL).
- Secrets only via env/Vault/SSM; **secret-scan** (gitleaks) blocks at pre-commit + CI.

## 7. Git & PR hygiene
- **Conventional Commits**; atomic commits; **PR ≤ ~400 lines** of diff (split larger ones).
- Each PR maps to one user story / issue ID; do **not** mix refactor + feature in one PR.
- Branch protection: no merge while CI is red; squash to keep history clean.

## 8. Dependencies
- **Pin versions** (commit the lockfile); \`npm/pip audit\` blocks High/Critical.
- Don't add a dependency for something small you can write; remove unused deps.

## 9. Documentation
- Public functions/classes have a **docstring** (purpose, params, return, throws).
- README/setup runs from scratch; ADRs updated when technical direction changes.

## 10. Frontend / UI (if applicable)
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**; keyboard-navigable; semantic HTML.
- No hardcoded colors/spacing — use **design tokens**.
- Handle **loading / empty / error** states for every async UI.

## 11. Internationalization (i18n) & Localization (l10n) — if UI/text-facing
**When:** Any user-facing text (web, mobile, emails, CLI messages).
- [ ] **No hardcoded user-facing strings** — all text via an i18n catalog (keys, not literals); lint rule fails the build on literal UI text.
- [ ] **Externalize from day one** — even single-language projects route text through the i18n layer so adding locales later is non-breaking.
- [ ] **ICU MessageFormat** for plurals/gender/select; **never concatenate translated fragments** (word order differs per language).
- [ ] **Locale-aware formatting** — dates, numbers, currency, units via \`Intl\`/locale APIs, never manual formatting.
- [ ] **RTL support** — logical CSS properties (\`margin-inline\`, \`text-align: start\`), \`dir\` attribute; test Arabic/Hebrew.
- [ ] **Layout tolerates ~+30–40% text expansion** vs English; no fixed-width controls that clip translations.
- [ ] **UTF-8 everywhere**; correct \`lang\`/charset attributes; no text baked into images (provide translatable alt text).
- [ ] **Translation keys carry context** for translators; no reusing one key across different contexts.
- [ ] **Pseudolocalization** in QA to catch hardcoded strings and truncation before real locales are added.

## 12. Backend / API & data services (if applicable)

### A. API contract & compatibility
- [ ] **Version the API** (\`/v1\`); no breaking change without a version bump. Deprecations carry a \`Sunset\` header + timeline.
- [ ] **Consistent error schema** (RFC 7807 \`application/problem+json\`); **semantically correct HTTP status codes** (404 vs 403 vs 409 vs 422).
- [ ] **Mass-assignment protection**: bind via DTO/allowlist fields; never map a request body straight onto an entity.
- [ ] (Public API) **consumer-driven contract tests** so clients don't break on change.

### B. Resilience & operability
- [ ] **Idempotency-Key** for non-idempotent endpoints (resource creation, payments) so retries are safe.
- [ ] **Retry with exponential backoff + jitter**; **circuit breaker** for downstreams; **bulkhead** to isolate pools.
- [ ] **Graceful shutdown**: drain in-flight requests, close pools; separate **liveness / readiness / health** probes.

### C. Data integrity & concurrency
- [ ] **Explicit transaction boundaries** with the correct **isolation level**; guard races with **optimistic/pessimistic locking** (avoid lost updates, deadlocks).
- [ ] **Zero-downtime migrations** (expand/contract), **reversible**, forward-only in prod; **never edit an applied migration**.
- [ ] **Money as integer minor units / decimal** (never float); **store timestamps in UTC**.

### D. Throughput protection
- [ ] **Rate limiting / throttling** + **request body size limits**.
- [ ] **Connection pool** sized appropriately; **query timeout** on every query.
- [ ] **Caching** with explicit TTL + **invalidation strategy**; support **ETag / conditional requests** where it fits.

### E. Authorization depth (beyond authentication)
- [ ] **Object-level authorization** on every resource access (prevent **IDOR/BOLA**) — not just "is the caller logged in".
- [ ] **CORS allowlist**; **CSRF** protection for cookie-based auth; **security headers**; **SSRF** guard on outbound URLs.

### F. Eventing / async (if a message bus is used)
- [ ] **Outbox pattern** / transactional messaging to keep DB and events consistent.
- [ ] **Idempotent consumers**; **dead-letter queue**; assume **at-least-once** delivery.

### G. Test depth
- [ ] **Integration tests against a real DB** (e.g. Testcontainers), not only mocks.
