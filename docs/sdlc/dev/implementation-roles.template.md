# Implementation roles by project type

Use only the roles that apply. Remove or ignore the rest. Tech Lead is cross-cutting; add discipline roles as needed.

## Model optimization strategy

| Role | Model tier | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Tech Lead | **Highest** (e.g. Opus) | Planning, logic analysis, architecture decisions, code review |
| All implementation roles | **Cost-efficient** (e.g. Haiku) | Execute code from Tech Lead's detailed specs |

Tech Lead defines all critical steps, logic, and specs first → implementation roles execute them. This maximizes quality on thinking while reducing cost on execution.

> **All roles must satisfy [Developer Quality Rules](./quality-rules.md) before opening a PR** (DoD, test quality, type-safety, error handling, performance budget, security, and i18n for UI). Tech Lead enforces it at review.

## By project type

| CLI / tooling       | Tech Lead, Senior Dev (or Senior Backend)           |
| Data / ML           | Tech Lead, Senior Backend, Senior Data/ML          |
