# sdlc-workflow

Scaffold SDLC workflow docs and templates into your project. Works with **Cursor**, **Claude**, **Antigravity**, and **Codex**.

## Flow

```
User Request → PO → Business BA → Design (if app/web) → Architect → Technical BA → QE (docs) → Dev → QE (testing + UAT) → [bug-fix loop until 0 bugs] → Security + PE audit → [fix → retest → re-audit loop until 0 issues] → Deploy → Maintenance
```

- **Trigger:** When you send an **idea** or **feature request**, the agent should run the **full pipeline** (PO → … → Deploy) in sequence, one sub-agent/role per phase — not handle everything in one go or stop after one phase. See `docs/sdlc/ORCHESTRATION.md`.
- **Design (optional):** For app/web projects, after Business BA → create **design specs** (Markdown) + optional **HTML wireframes**; **PO + Business BA review** until approved; then Architect + Technical BA. UX drives technical decisions.
- **QE bug-fix loop:** After QE finds bugs → Dev fixes → QE retests → repeat until 0 open bugs.
- **Security + Principle Engineer:** After QE sign-off (0 bugs) → security + logic audit; **fix → retest → re-audit loop** (Dev fixes → QE retests → re-audit) until 0 issues/vulnerabilities; sign-off before Deploy.
- **Each role runs as a sub-agent** (see `docs/sdlc/agents/`).
- **After completion** → deploy immediately with **Docker Compose** (local/staging) and **Kubernetes** (production) — `docs/sdlc/deploy/`.
- **Maintenance:** After Deploy → monitoring, bug fixes, patches, dependency updates, performance tuning — `docs/sdlc/maintenance/`.
- **QE (docs)**: Test plan, test cases
- **Dev**: After docs phase → **run implementation immediately**. Tech Lead (review, merge) + Senior Dev (implement, Unit Test ≥90%)
- **QE (testing)**: QE Lead (15+ yrs automation: strategy, framework, review) + Senior QE (10+ yrs, write automation tests)

## Usage

### `init` — Project setup

In your project directory:

```bash
npx sdlc-workflow init
```

Creates project-level files:
- `docs/sdlc/` — SDLC docs, templates, and phase folders
- `.cursor/rules/sdlc-workflow.mdc` — Cursor rule
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code instructions
- `AGENTS.md` — Antigravity, Codex (universal project guidance)
- `.agents/skills/sdlc-workflow/` — Codex repo skill

### `install` — Global setup

```bash
npx sdlc-workflow install
```

Installs global skills (run once per machine):
- `~/.cursor/skills/sdlc-workflow/` — Cursor skill
- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` — Codex global instructions
- `~/.agents/skills/sdlc-workflow/` — Codex global skill

```

## Use with Cursor

The rule `.cursor/rules/sdlc-workflow.mdc` activates when working with `docs/sdlc/**` or `*.md`. Global skill: `~/.cursor/skills/sdlc-workflow/`.

## Use with Claude

- **Claude Code** (project): `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Claude loads it when you open this project.
- **Claude.ai** (web): Copy `docs/sdlc/SDLC-WORKFLOW.md` into Custom Instructions or @ mention it.

## Use with Antigravity

`AGENTS.md` at project root — Antigravity reads it (priority: AGENTS.md → GEMINI.md). Universal format, works across agentic IDEs.

## Use with Codex

- **Project**: `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/skills/sdlc-workflow/`
- **Global**: `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` + `~/.agents/skills/sdlc-workflow/`

## Release

1. Add `NPM_TOKEN` (npm access token) to repo **Settings → Secrets → Actions**.
2. Push a version tag:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

3. GitHub Action publishes to npm and creates a GitHub Release.
